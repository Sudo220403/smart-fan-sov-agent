NDKD-B_i3mg,Ugwctc0UV-_ALZIdEq54AaABAg,atomberg,"Manufacturers of BLDC fans, like Atomberg, often don‚Äôt have service engineers available to repair their own PCBs. I started installing BLDC fans back when the technology wasn‚Äôt as popular as it is today, and over time, some of those fan PCBs stopped working. Instead of offering repair services, manufacturers usually replace the entire PCB, which helps them maintain their profits. In some cases, if the fan model has been discontinued, even the replacement PCB might not be available. So, while BLDC fans can help you save on energy, they won‚Äôt necessarily save you money ‚Äî because whatever you save on electricity will likely need to be spent later on replacing a faulty PCB.",positive,0.9738,0.227,0.032,0.74

I started installing BLDC fans back when the technology wasn‚Äôt as popular as it is today, and over time, some of those fan PCBs stopped working. Instead of offering repair services, manufacturers usually replace the entire PCB, which helps them maintain their profits. In some cases, if the fan model has been discontinued, even the replacement PCB might not be available. So, while BLDC fans can help you save on energy, they won‚Äôt necessarily save you money ‚Äî because whatever you save on electricity will likely need to be spent later on replacing a faulty PCB.",positive,0.9738,0.227,0.032,0.74

I started installing BLDC fans back when the technology wasn‚Äôt as popular as it is today, and over time, some of those fan PCBs stopped working. Instead of offering repair services, manufacturers usually replace the entire PCB, which helps them maintain their profits. In some cases, if the fan model has been discontinued, even the replacement PCB might not be available. So, while BLDC fans can help you save on energy, they won‚Äôt necessarily save you money ‚Äî because whatever you save on electricity will likely need to be spent later on replacing a faulty PCB.",positive,0.9738,0.227,0.032,0.74

I started installing BLDC fans back when the technology wasn‚Äôt as popular as it is today, and over time, some of those fan PCBs stopped working. Instead of offering repair services, manufacturers usually replace the entire PCB, which helps them maintain their profits. In some cases, if the fan model has been discontinued, even the replacement PCB might not be available. So, while BLDC fans can help you save on energy, they won‚Äôt necessarily save you money ‚Äî because whatever you save on electricity will likely need to be spent later on replacing a faulty PCB.",positive,0.9738,0.227,0.032,0.74
